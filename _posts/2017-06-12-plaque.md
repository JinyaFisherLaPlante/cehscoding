Today CEEF congratulated us on our grant by presenting the club with an engraved plaque commemorating the grant and certificates for individual members.

>The Coding Club grant was one of the fastest we've ever approved.  Everyone on the board keeps talking about how great their presentation was and we look forward to see what they will achieve.
